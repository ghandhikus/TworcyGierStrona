/**
 * Package for model classes from MVC.
 * <br>
 * Model represents the data, their storage, and operations on them.
 * <br>
 * Data is represented as plain old data objects(POJO).
 * <br>
 * Persistence also called Storage, is represented as data access objects(DAO) or repositories which usually cover multiple tables instead of just one.
 * <br>
 * Operations are represented by Services, to use the data in code you use Services.
 * They contain only methods for data manipulation, so that you don't need to handle the data itself or the persistence.
